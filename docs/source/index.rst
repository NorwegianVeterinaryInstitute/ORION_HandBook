This website aims to be a handbook that can help national and local labs to
build capacity and competence on the use of NGS methods for surveillance
purposes. This work was started as part of the `"One health surRveillance
Initiative On harmonization of data collection and interpretatioN
(ORION)" <https://onehealthejp.eu/jip-orion/>`__ One Health EJP project, and
continued as part of the `"BeOne: Building Integrative Tools for One Health
Surveillance" <https://onehealthejp.eu/jrp-beone/>` project.

The ORION project, launched in 2018, aimed at establishing and strengthening
inter-institutional collaboration and transdisciplinary knowledge transfer in
the area of surveillance data integration and interpretation, along the One
Health (OH) objective of improving health and well-being. The BeONE project,
launched in 2020, aims at developing an integrated surveillance dashboard in
which molecular and epidemiological data for foodborne pathogens can be
interactively analysed, visualised and interpreted by the relevant experts
across disciplines and sectors.
